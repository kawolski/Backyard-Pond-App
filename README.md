# Backyard-Pond-App
Used to control backyard electronics, basically near pond, for pond
Since, in the garden we cannot install switches (basically in our backyard there is no such SAFE place to apply any switches), due to the
risk of electrocuting ourselves while watering plants, I created a sealed bluetooth system which manages all the pond electronics
including sensors and some watering,waterfall valves...(all the stuff related to fancy backyard).
Currently this only controls lights and a single waterfall pump and a water temperature sensor, but soon it will be updated with lots of
other stuff like automatic water level management system and automatic food dispenser (in case we are on vacation) and many more.
